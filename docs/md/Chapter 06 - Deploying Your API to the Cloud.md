# Benefits and Responsibilities of Cloud Deployment
* The cloud is an informal term to refer to the collection of computer servers and connecting infrastructure that make the public internet.
* Benefits:
	* Learn the end-to-end process of cloud development
	* You can share it.
	* You can use internet-facing tools and products to explore from the user's perspective
	* You can use generative AI services to consumer the API.
* Responsibilities:
	* They can cost you a fortune if you don't pay attention, how to control the costs?
		* Review the costs of services before using them, use cost calculation if available.
		* Use services with free tires and free trial periods.
		* Create monthly budgets and set up email notifications to notify you when you are approaching budgeted amounts.
		* Shut down or delete resources after use. 
		* When you have finished working with a cloud host, clean up resources and remove your payment method.
		* Keep tight control of your login credentials.
		* Use short-lived access keys
		* Only activate the permissions for specific services you are using, and disable them after you are done.
		* Do not commit any credentials into source control repositories.
		* If any credentials do become exposed, deactivate or delete them.
	* Security, expose your API endpoints comes with responsibility of keeping API keys, user, password safe from bad actors

# Choosing a Cloud Host for Your Project
* It depends on your use case.
	* Continuous integrations (CI)
	* Containerization
* Render
	* Start command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
* AWS

# Shipping Your Application in a Docker Container
* Docker is a very useful tool for shipping applications in containers.
	* Dockerfile: is a text document to build a Docker image.
	* Container/Docker Image: an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime.
	* Repository: is a set of Docker images.
	* Container runtime: is software that uses the image to create a container, which is a runtime instance of a container image.
## Some Docker Commands and Their Purpose
* `docker --version`: Verify what version of the library is installed.
* `docker build -t`: Build an image from a Dockerfile.
* `docker images`: List local images in your environment.
* `docker run`: Run a container from a local image.

## Dockerfile
* Dockerfile contains the instructions that Docker will use to create a container image.

## Creating a `.dockerignore` File
* like `.gitignore` when you want to exclude some files in your directory from the Docker image

## Building a Container Image
```bash
docker build -t apicontainerimage .
docker images
docker run --publish 80:80 --name apicontainerl
docker run --publish 80:80 --name apicontainer1 apicontainerimage
```
